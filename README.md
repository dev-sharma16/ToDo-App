# To-Do App 🎯

A simple and interactive **To-Do App** that allows users to **add, edit, delete, and complete tasks**. It features a **progress bar** that updates dynamically as tasks are completed. When all tasks are marked as done, a **celebration animation** appears. 🚀

## Features ✨

✅ **Add Tasks** - Users can add tasks by entering text in the input field and clicking the submit button.  
✅ **Edit Tasks** - Users can edit existing tasks by clicking the edit icon, which fills the input field with the task text for modification.  
✅ **Delete Tasks** - Users can remove a task by clicking the delete icon.  
✅ **Mark as Completed** - Tasks can be marked as completed using a checkbox, which updates the progress bar.  
✅ **Progress Bar** - Shows the progress of completed tasks dynamically.  
✅ **Celebration Animation** - When all tasks are checked as completed, a fun blast animation is triggered. 🎉  
✅ **Persistent Storage** - Tasks are saved in `localStorage`, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
